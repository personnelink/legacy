2010.08.30:
* createNewUser.asp: error redirecting page [modifying header after it was written too]
* createNewUser.asp: layout broken [not sure when it broke, but its been that way for a bit]; built new style section in general.asp.css
* common.asp: function make_input: added a "no wrap" contingency where is wrap_text is empty function assumes no wrap; before function would output empty  tags "<></>"

2010.08.26:
* createApplication.asp: additional scripting to handle eletronic signing of forms and filing
* EmploymentApplication.pdf: added additional fields for signatures and missing/overlooked data

2010.08.25:
* worked on w4 branch of application
* worked on integrating Applicant Agreement electronic signature into submitApplication script; default behavior now hides legal verbiage if already signed.
* changed electronic signature behavior to hide legalese if applicant has already signed.

2010.08.17:
* debugged submitApplication.asp, issues integrating kill_guest with new session management; rescripted
* global_functions: modified function StripIt to not escape out single apostrophes; this functionality was integregrated into function insert_string for database interactions [and comes after several hours of trying find why the ____ apostrophes keep doubling!
* collected together files for init_unsecure_session.asp (called by createNewUser.asp and non-secure pages); this primarily so that the file name becomes self evident next to its counter part, init_secure_session ...
* found variable name conflict variable: user_id declared publicly and called privately in function begin_session()
* bug: break in createNewUser.asp; needed to rescript how the script interacts with the newer methods for handling user sessions and presentation page header;
* bug: all modules that use function UserLevelRequired(this) will need to be updated to use session("required_user_level") = this instead to direct the system to act appropriately
* aspPageName: moved to public scope
* reincarnated function userLevelRequired() to handle spot security for individual secure page furniture items

2010.08.16:
* finished feature extension and behaviour alteration for searchForm.asp [network documents and resume search]; altered behavior to not require any "content" properties before beginning search; default criteria returns past 14 days of most recent resumes specific to the users branch.

* Published dev to secure; all source corrent.

2010.08.14 : Worked on Dev Build
* Altered include/core/
  - moved global_declarations.asp into
  - renamed masterPageTop.asp --> init_secure_session.asp
  - added: session("required_user_level")
  - created: navigation.asp and linked in bottom global_declarations.asp

* deprecated function userLevelRequired(); was no longer compatible
* the following were added to improve application module interoperability, performance, scalabilty and dev:
  - built function bottomPageRecords (nPageCount, oldQueryString)
  - built function LookUpBread (breadCrumb)
  - Function BreadCrumb(FullPath)
    * this was started as fixing a related interoperability issue with the mysql session_state functions

* worked on searchForm.asp as it was giving an error, I was in the middle of adding features a week ago and it was behind deadline and it allowed me to troubleshoot and debug the core modules that are not stable yet {leading to the other noted activities for today}

* added: no_you_heading and no_you_body to global_declarations.asp

2010.08.13
* split site code into a production folder and a dev folder
* created a development server and pointed cfg at dev folder
* rold site code back to August 1 [more stable build]
* stiched in debug server to site source, added additional support for future proof in header handling and corrected a web session issue for database connection when using unknown header.
* refreshed original requisitioncenter module with updated schema changes and plugged it into userHome, dev tier

2010.08.09
*  moved web header into a variable first before sending; this in order for redirects to work and too allow sending a partial header resonse to client to speed up downloads of other resources while the script is still procressing.
* changed global baseURL to point to personnelplus-inc.com
2010.08.06
* checkSignIn.asp: noGuestSession method broke with session management change; updated code to use current session state manager
* global_functions.asp: userLevelRequired function call failed in some modules do to an "order of operations" problem; the function was being called before support procedures could be initialized.
* security: branchHours.asp: exposed to guest

2010.08.05
* corrected issue with cascading notes when multiple insertions are done

* createApplication.asp, action=insert; [bug with temps conduit], Microsoft JET Database Engine error ''80040e57''; found problem with temps schema only allowing 30 characters; scripted exception to truncate anything over 30 before injecting.

* reportBug.asp: error ''80004005''; located issue with session_state_manager change and how new procedures require processing to be done in header before any response is sent to client; changed order of operations and change response.redirect to server.transfer method.

2010.08.04
* while debugging a different error located a minor issue with the core session manager; there is no session id to track whilst in transition bewteen sessions; aka the malformed null in the first value this string: 
insert into web_sessions_data (session, key, data) values ('', 'homeMessage', 'Whoops, there is some confusion...'); db schema requires session id ... will fix later [23:03pm]

* searchForm.asp, make display recent two weeks by default, in progress

* viewCustomers.asp created

2010.08.03
* Roughed initial checkHistory.asp and tied it into maintain Applicant.

* Finished 'update' action scripting for maintainApplicant.asp

* Finished extending session state manager to allow saving of unique session data, to replace Session("")

* Bug found in createNewUser.asp allowing in unsanitized input from field 'city';

* maintainApplicant.asp created; rough concept.

2010.08.01:
* Updated VMS core header response for caching and IE specific items.
* Centralized record paging css to global.css from unique add-in classes; changed format to match other search options extensions.
* viewTimecards.asp  alpha module almost ready for evaluation.
* Found old non sql queries in viewApplications.asp that were gathering address information manuall via script instead of with INNER JOINS

2010.07.31: createNewUser.asp extended functionality to encompass new business client enrollments; pplusvms catalogue modified schemas: can't remember. :)

2009.09.04 : Added noise prepocessor to searchForm.asp [Resume and NetDocs search] for searches

2009.03.18
* searchForm.asp addressed indexing service issue 

2009.01.19:
