<b>What is "Remember Me"?</b><br>
When you sign into Personnel Plus using your user name and password,
your web browser can be told to remember this information. By checking the "Remember Me" box
you can avoid having to login again during future visits from <em>this computer</em>.<p>
You will have to login again if you switch to another computer or have not visited us in a while.  Because of this, it's important 
to <em>keep track of your user name and password</em> for your account.
<p>
<b>Special Considerations:</b><br>
if you use a shared computer (in an office, library, cafe, airport,
or other such public area) you should <b>not</b> check the "Remember Me" checkbox.
This will prevent others from being able to view your personal information.
<p>
<b>Can I turn off "Remember Me"?</b><br>
Easily.  You can turn it off by clicking any <strong>logout</strong> link.
Once you have logged out, you will need
to sign in again if you want to access your personal profile, resume, and job applications.
