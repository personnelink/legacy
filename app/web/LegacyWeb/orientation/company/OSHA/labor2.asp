				<h4>Hazard Communication:</h4>
			</p>
			<p>
				Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, you have a <a href="/orientation/rights.asp" target="_blank">"Right to Know"</a> about<br>
				chemical hazards in the workplace. Your client company should provide you with <a href="/orientation/rights.asp" target="_blank">"Right<br>
				to Know"</a> information about chemical hazards in their workplace.
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul><B>Remember, <i>Hazard Communication</i> can protect you only if you:</B>
					<li>Read labels and Material Safety Data Sheets</li>
					<li>Know where to find information about your chemicals</li>
					<li>Follow instructions and warnings</li>
					<li>Use the correct protective clothing and equipment when handling hazardous<br>

			</p>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<B>You may be assigned to a job that involves working with moving parts of machinery.  If<BR>
				so, you need to understand the client company's machine guarding policy.  The following<BR>
				will help protect you:</B>
					<li>Make sure guards or shields are in place before using machinery.  Don't wear rings,<br>
						watches or bracelets to work.  They can easily get caught on surface edges, machinery<br>
						and moving parts, and may cause injury to a finger or hand.</li>
					<li>Be alert for the unexpected.  Think ahead and realize what you're telling your wrists,<br>
						hands and fingers to do.</li>
					<li>Use the right personal protective equipment (PPE) for the job -- including gloves,<br>
						hand pads, barrier creams, etc.</li>
					<li>Follow procedures for operating and maintaining equipment.  Never bypass safety<br>
						features or take a "short cut" -- you could take a "sharp cut" instead.</li>
					<li>Notify your supervisor about guards that are inoperable or do not protect at the point<br>
						of operation.</li>

				<h4>Lockout/Tagout:</h4>
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Lockout/Tagout</i> is a method of keeping equipment from being set in motion and<BR>
				endangering workers.  Each client company will have their own <i>Lockout/Tagout</i><BR>
				program.  It will include all or parts of the following:
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul><b>The Control of hazardous energy must be done according to a six-step procedure --</b>
					<li>Preparation for shutdown</li>
					<li>Equipment shutdown</li>
					<li>Equipment isolation</li>
					<li>Application of <i>Lockout/Tagout</i> devices</li>
					<li>Control of stored energy</li>
					<li>Equipment -- isolation verification</li>
				</ul>
				<ul><b>Before removing the lock --</b>
					<li>Make sure equipment is safe</li>
					<li>Conduct a head count</li>
					<li>Notify all affected personnel that lockout is being removed</li>
				</ul>
				<UL><B>Special situations to be aware of --</b>
					<li>Outside contractors</li>
					<li>Temporarily reactivating equipment </li>
					<li>Servicing that lasts more than one shift</li>
					<li>Removal of lockout by personnel who did not apply</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				Your supervisor at the client company will instruct you on their policy.  Do not remove<BR>
				any <i>Lockout/Tagout</i> devices unless specifically directed by your supervisor.

				<H4>Hand/Portable Power Tools and Equipment:</H4>
			</P>
			<p>
				The proper way to use all hand and portable tools should be strongly emphasized.  Your<br>
				supervisor should provide proper operating instructions.  Today's hand-operated power<br>
				tools are lighter, more powerful and easier to use than before.  Because of this, special<br>
				care must be taken to avoid careless accidents and injuries.
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>Use the right tool for a particular job.</li>
					<li>Know the proper way to use each tool.</li>
					<li>Know why tools work the way they do.</li>
					<li>Know why tools are designed only for certain jobs.</li>
					<li>Use (and keep) tools in good condition.</li>
					<li>Keep tools in a safe place.</li>
					<li>Check all moving parts to make sure that they work smoothly and easily but are free of<br>
						any play or wiggle.</li>
					<li>Never use a tool with a dulled cutting blade or bit, or a loose part.</li>
					<li>Always wear protection equipment.</li>
					<li>Ask for proper operating instructions if your supervisor does not provide them to you.</li>

				<H4>Personal Protective Equipment:</H4>
				</p>
			<p>
				Personal protective equipment, or <b>PPE</b>, is designed to protect you from health and safety<br>
				hazards that cannot practically be removed from our work environment.  PPE will not<br>
				protect you from all hazards, but it could mean the difference between a bruised foot and<br>
				a crushed foot.  The client company or Personnel Plus will provide you with the proper<br>
				<i>Personal Protective Equipment</i>.  <i>Personal Protective Equipment</i> is designed to protect<br>
				many parts of your body including:
			</p>
			<p>
				<UL>
					<li>Eyes</li>
					<li>Face</li>
					<li>Head</li>
					<li>Hands</li>
					<li>Feet</li>
					<li>Ears</li>
					<li>Lungs</li>
				</UL>
			</p>
			<p>
				It is your employer's responsibility to teach you what personal protective equipment you<br>
				need.  However, it is your responsibility to wear it  No one can use it for you.  PPE must<br>
				be used correctly to protect you and is designed for your benefit.  For your sake, and for<br>
				those who love you and need you, lean how to use PPE -- but most importantly -- use it.

				<H4>Manual Material Handling:</H4>
			</P>
			<p>
				Since a large number of injuries occur to fingers, hands, arms and backs, people need to<br>
				be taught how to pick up and put down heavy, bulky or long objects.  Some general<br>
				precautions are:
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>Inspect materials for slivers, jagged edges, burrs, rough or slippery surfaces.</li>
					<li>Get a firm grip on the object.</li>
					<li>Keep fingers away from pinch points, especially when putting materials down.</li>
					<li>When handling lumber, pipe or other long objects, keep hands away from the ends to<br>
						prevent hands from being pinched.</li>
					<li>Wipe off greasy, wet, slippery or dirty objects before trying to handle them.</li>
					<li>Keep hands free of oil and grease.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<B>With regard to lifting and carrying:</B>
					<li>Never overexert yourself when lifting.  if the load is thought to be more than one<br>
						person can handle, ask for help.</li>
					<li>Lift gradually, without jerking, to minimize the effects of acceleration.</li>
					<li>Keep the load close to the body.</li>
					<li>Lift without twisting the body.</li>
					<li>Follow safe lifting procedures.</li>

				<H4>Emergency Procedures:</H4>
			</p>
			<p>
				The client company to which you are assigned will have a written, up-to-date <strong>Emergency Action<br>
				Plan</strong> for your workplace.  Make sure you read and understand the <strong>Emergency Action Plan</strong> of the<br>
				client as it relates to your work area.
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul><b>The following items may be included in the <i>Emergency Action Plan</i>:</b>
					<li>The plan should contain information about evacuation from the<br>
						facility, including who is in charge of the evacuation.</li>
					<li>Primary and secondary escape routes should be outlined for every<br>
						area of the building.  Since stairways are the primary escape route<br>
						in multiple-story buildings, they should not be used for any kind of<br>
						storage.</li>
					<li><i>Emergency Action Leaders</i> should be assigned specific duties, such<br>
						as verifying that all workers have evacuated.</li>
					<li>Pre-fire planning must clearly show the locations of the<br>
						workstations of disabled workers.</li>
					<li>Disabled workers and those with known medical problems, such as<br>
						heart disease or epilepsy, should each be assigned an <i>Emergency<br>
						Action Leader</i> to guide them to safety.</li>
					<li>All other workers who might need assistance during a fire should<br>
						be identified during planning.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<b>How to evacuate a burning building:</b>
					<li>The last one out of the room should not lock the door, just close it.</li>
					<ul><li>Locking the door hinders the fire department's search and rescue<br>
						efforts.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Proceed to the exit as outlined in the <i>Emergency Action Plan</i>.</li>
					<li>Don't use elevators under any circumstances.</li>
					<li>Stay low to avoid smoke and toxic gases.  The best air is close to<br>
						the floor, so crawl if necessary.</li>
					<li>if possible, cover your mouth and nose with damp cloth to help you<br>
						breathe.</li>
					<li>if you work in a building with multiple stories, a stairway will be<br>
						your primary escape route.</li>
					<li>Once in the stairwell, proceed on to the first floor.  Never go up.</li>
					<li>Once outside the building, report to a predetermined area so that a<br>
						head count can be taken.</li>
				</ul>

			</p>
			<p>
				Only trained personnel should be allowed to operate industrial trucks.  Lift truck<br>
				operating rules must be posted and strictly enforced by the client company at which you<br>

					<li>You are prohibited from placing your arms and legs between the uprights of the mast<br>
						or outside the running lines of the truck.</li>
					<li>When a powered industrial truck is left unattended, load-engaging means shall be<br>
						fully lowered, controls neutralized, power shut off and brakes set.  Wheels shall be<br>
						blocked if the truck is parked on an incline.</li>
					<li>A safe distance shall be maintained from the edge of ramps or platforms on any<br>
						elevated dock, or platform on a freight car.  Trucks shall not be used for opeing or<br>
						closing freight doors.</li>
					<li>Use only approved industrial trucks in hazardous locations.</li>
