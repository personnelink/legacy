<p><strong>General Collected Information<br>
                    </strong>In general, 
                    we gather information about all of our users collectively, 
                    such as what areas users visit most frequently and what services 
                    users access the most. We only use such data anonymously and 
                    in the aggregate. We also collect an IP (Internet Protocol) 
                    address from all visitors to our site. We use your IP address 
                    to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer 
                    our site. Your IP address is also used to help identify you 
                    when you visit and keep your information secure. This information 
                    helps us determine what is most beneficial for our users, 
                    and how we can continually create a better overall experience 
                    for you. We may share this information with our partners, 
                    but only in the aggregate, so that they too may understand 
                    how Personnel Plus, Inc. visitors use our site, so they may create 
                    a better overall experience for you, as well.</p>

                    and providing customer service. These other companies will 
                    have access to your personal information as necessary to perform 
                    their functions, but they may not share that information with 
                    any third party.

                    Resumes</strong><br>
                     Since Personnel Plus, Inc. 
                    contains services for job finders (&quot;Members&quot;) to 
                    submit online resumes to potential employers, the resume information 
                    will be saved in our database. Your resume may be &quot;activated&quot; 
                    as searchable or &quot;deactivated&quot; for private job applying. 
                    The two options are: 
                  <ol>
                    <li>When you build 
                      a resume online you may leave it in our database as &quot;deactivated&quot; 
                      which will not allow it to be searchable by potential employers. 
                      Not allowing your resume to be searchable means that you 
                      can use it to apply for a job online, but employers and 
                      recruiters will not have access to search it through our 
                      resume database product.<br>
                      <br>
                       
                    <li>By &quot;activating&quot; 
                      your online resume you allow your resume to be searchable, 
                      then all employers and recruiters who pay for access to 
                      our resume database product will have access to your resume. 
                       
                      <p> We use our 
                        best efforts to grant access to this database only to 
                        paying employers, recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters, 
                        and human resource professionals, but cannot guarantee 
                        that other parties will not, without our consent, gain 
                        access to this database. You may remove your resume from 
                        our searchable database at any time. However, employers 
                        and recruiters who have paid for access to the database, 
                        and other parties who have otherwise gained access to 
                        the database, may have retained a copy of your resume 
                        in their own files or databases. We are not responsible 
                        for the retention, use, or privacy of resumes in these 
                        instances, or for the use or privacy of resumes by any 
                        of such parties while resumes are in the database.
