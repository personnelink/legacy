<a name="intro"></a>						
<h5> Introduction</h5>
A resume is a brief synopsis of your educational background, employment history, skills, interests, and accomplishments.  More importantly it is your personal advertisement  - the principal marketing tool through which you can convincingly demonstrate to potential employers your suitability for their job vacancies.  The candidate most likely to secure an interview is the one who has developed an effective resume.
<p>
A good resume helps you gain confidence in yourself by making you more aware of what you have to offer to employers.  The content and format should reveal not only your achievements and proven abilities, but also your individuality and career goals or objectives.  The resume will show a prospective employer how organized and prepared you are and how seriously you take yourself.
<p>
<b>Your resume is personal, fashion it to your own needs. if need be create several resumes and select the more appropriate one when applying online.</b>
<p>  
Remember this document reflects you, it is the employer's first introduction to you and you must try to give the best possible impression.
<p>
Make it concise, well organized, neat and free from errors.
Remember layout is important, make it easy to read by using plenty of white space.
<ul>
<li>Be consistent, choose a style and stick with it</li>
<li>Presentation is important, make it look professional</li>
<li>Be brief, one page is good, two pages maximum</li>
<li>Be positive, speak of your achievements </li>
<li>Be energetic, show enthusiasm </li>
<li>Be truthful</li>
</ul>
<b>Tip:</b> Posting your resume online:
<p>
Consider also posting a version of your resume completely free from formatting or graphics, which will scan and email more easily in a variety of platforms and systems.
<p>
<div align="right"><a href="#top">TOP</a></div>
<hr size="1" noshade>


<a name="contact"></a>
<h5> Contact Information</h5>
This is usually at the beginning of the resume and includes the following:
<p></p>
Full Name - first and last name<br>
Address - use complete address, city, state, province, country, postal code<br>
Telephone  - home or message - be sure to include the area code<br> 
E-mail - ensure that you can regularly check it for messages<br>
<p>
<b>* tips </b>
<ul>
<li>Avoid using the obvious such as entitling your resume, "Resume" or preceding your name with the word, "Name:"</li>
<li>Your age, sex, marital status, health, SIN and citizenship are not required.</li>
</ul>
<div align="right"><a href="#top">TOP</a></div>
<hr size="1" noshade>

 
<a name="objective"></a> 
<h5> Career Goals or Employment Objective</h5>
<p>An objective gives your resume focus and direction; it is the anchor to which all the
other elements of your resume relate. It shows that you are a person with a purpose.
Recent surveys indicate that most employers prefer to see an objective. Without an
objective, you force employers to dig through your resume to try to determine the
objective for themselves. How many do you think will take the time to do that?</p>
<p></p>
However, stating an employment or career goal is optional. Objectives are also helpful when you are trying to show a relationship between your skills and a particular position.  It may be better to include an objective once you are into your second or third year in your profession and have a better idea what direction you intend to pursue. 
<p></p>
Avoid using general statements like "I would like to work in the field of Computer Science". 
<div align="right"><a href="#top">TOP</a></div>
<hr size="1" noshade>



<a name="education"></a>
<h5> Education</h5>
When describing your educational background, the following information should be provided:
<ol>
	<li>Program of study including area of specialization
	<li>Period of attendance or date of graduation
	<li>Name and location of educational institution
	<li>Other degrees, diplomas or certificates attained (if any)<br>
    <li>List the degree earned, graduation date, name of the institution,
    major/minor areas of study, and the city and state of the
    university/college.</li>
	e.g.  Candidate for Bachelor of Science, Major in Computer Science, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, September 1999 - present.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<b>* tips</b>
<ul>
	<li>Document your educational background in reverse order beginning with your most recent achievements</li>
	<li>Indicate the degree/diploma/certificate you received before the name of the school attended</li>
	<li>if you have had little relevant work experience, you may include a sub heading to Education entitled " Relevant Courses" - list 6-10 relevant courses (2nd year or higher) by name (don't include course #)</li>
	<li>Do not include your GPA if it is less than 3.0 </li>
	<li>List classes taken only if your job experience is very limited, or if your job experience is in an unrelated field</li>
</ul>
<div align="right"><a href="#top">TOP</a></div>
<hr size="1" noshade>



<a name="awards"></a>
<h5> Honours and Awards</h5>
List any scholarships and/or awards you have received.
<p></p>
Include title of award, dates and monetary amounts if you feel it will help your cause.  These should be listed immediately after Education.
<hr size="1" noshade>

<a name="hobbies"></a>
<h5>Hobbies and Interests</h5>
<p>
This section offers an opportunity to supply data which does not fit neatly into other categories. Those who have a limited employment history often find this section extremely valuable as it allows them to present job-related skills, knowledge and achievements acquired through a wide variety of experiences (e.g. leadership ability through student organizations or volunteer work). The following information may be included:
<ul>
<li>Membership in professional associations or other organizations</li>
<li>Hobbies and leisure interests</li>
<li>Sports</li>
<li>Additional languages</li>
<li>Non-academic courses</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Volunteer/Community Work</b>
<p>
There are several ways to highlight or emphasize your volunteer activities:
<p><ul>
<li>Create a separate heading, e.g. Volunteer Activities, Volunteer Experience or Community Service - In this section you can either list the organizations, or if the involvement is extensive, you can add more detail about your contributions (use action verbs as in describing job duties)<p>
<li>if your volunteer activities are as important, or more relevant, than your paid work experience, add your information to your Work Experience Section with a volunteer notation ,e.g. Web Developer (Volunteer) 
</ul>
<div align="right"><a href="#top">TOP</a></div>
<hr size="1" noshade>


<a name="skills"></a>
<h5> Skills</h5>
Categorize your skills under headings, for example: Software, Hardware, Operating Systems, Languages.  This will make it easier for an employer to quickly determine which skills you possess.
<p>
Employers are <b>most</b> interested in finding out what you can do for them. For technical skills, include specific names of software and hardware with which you are proficient, as well as platforms, browsers, and programming languages you are confident in using. List your "personal skills" as well, such as "organizational ability" or "excellent communication".
<p></p>
By taking an inventory of your past accomplishments, you will also
      enable yourself to identify what you can do, or what your skills are. Identifying your skills,
      learning how they transfer to new positions or areas, and determining new skills you may need
      to develop to improve your employability are all necessary elements for successful career
      management.
      <p>To avoid being too vague or general when discussing skills, it may be useful to break them
      down into four distinct categories:
      <p><b>Functional skills</b><br>
      Skills related to, or acquired within, different organizational functions or units. Examples
      of functional skill areas include: warehousing, banking and finance, distribution management,
      electronic data processing operations, health and education, manufacturing, marketing, and
      personnel
      <p><b>Technical skills</b><br>
      Skills acquired through specialized education or work experience. Examples include: arithmetic skills, computer skills, graphic skills, machinery skills, manual
      skills, secretarial skills, and writing skills.
      <p><b>Administrative/Managerial skills</b><br>
      Skills that facilitate and enhance administrative processes. Examples include: analyzing, controlling, creating, delegating, directing others, innovating,
      leading, motivating, organizing, planning, and problem-solving.
<p></p>
      
<b>Accomplishment skills</b>
<p></p>
Below are examples of skills derived from accomplishment statements:
<ol>      
<li>Assisted in setting up new overtime reporting systems which consolidated
three systems into one (Analysis &amp; problem-solving).</li>
<li>Initiated new program to increase production by 20% and reduce average
turnaround time from five to four days (Innovation, organizing, &amp;
manufacturing).</li>
<li>Conducted competitive studies of duplicating equipment, computer work
stations, and telephones, saving division $90,000 (Analysis,
computer, cost control, perseverance).</li>
</ol> 
See <A HREF="#whatis">What is an Accomplishment?</A> below for more help.
<div align="right"><a href="#top">TOP</a></div>
<hr size="1" noshade>


<a name="experience"></a>
<h5>Work Experience</h5>
<p>
Work experience, like education, is normally listed in reverse chronological order.   Resumes may be tailored in this section by elaborating on the positions which would have most relevance to the job you are currently applying for.
The following information is generally provided in this section:
<p><ul>
<li>period of employment (start and end dates)</li>
<li>position title (create an accurate on if none existed)</li>
<li>name and location of employer</li>
<li>a brief summary of responsibilities, skills used and developed</li>
<li>noteworthy achievements/accomplishments on the job</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>document your work experience in reverse chronological order starting with your most recent job</li>
<li>if the position was summer, part-time, temporary or co-op indicate this when stating the period of employment</li>
<li>prioritize the job duties most pertinent to your career objectives (i.e. related to the job for which you are applying ) as this will grab the employer's attention</li>
<li>document the results you achieved by including numbers , e.g. developed and implemented database for inventory control 1 month ahead of schedule.</li>
<li>indicate level of responsibility, e.g. supervised 10 volunteers;  managed dept. in absence of supervisor. </li>
<li> describe skills by using action verbs such as planned, organized, implemented, created, supervised, analyzed, designed... (see list of "descriptive verbs" at end of this handout)</li>
<li>use adjectives and adverbs to express skill-related personal qualities and describe how responsibilities were performed, e.g. "responded to emergencies in a consistently calm and methodical manner".</li>
<li>in less relevant work, emphasize transferable skills, e.g. ability to work under pressure, communication skills, and interpersonal skills.</li>
<li>you may wish to remove unrelated jobs as you gain more experience, keeping only those with relevant skills</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Employers are generally looking for:</b>
<ul>
<li>Technical skills</li>
<li>Communication skills</li>
<li>Commitment to the job	</li>
<li>Acceptance of responsibility</li>
<li>Inter-personal skills</li>
<li>Evidence of teamwork</li>
<li>Decision making	leadership</li>
</ul>
<p>
<em>Remember...</em>
<p>
Stress accomplishments over job duties, utilizing specific examples or solid figures where applicable; indicate the skills used to attain these results.
<li><STRONG>Tip:</STRONG> When listing EXPERIENCE, be brief but precise.<p>

The employer may not dedicate much time for reading your resume. Shorten your job descriptions to precise phrases, separated by a comma or period. Do not start phrases with the word "I..."<p>
<p>

        
<ul>
    <li>List your experience in reverse chronological order</li>
    <li>Include any relevant internships, volunteer work, summer jobs, special projects, or military experience (you could create separate headings for these different types of experiences)</li>
<li>Replace typical job description statements with accomplishment statements</li>
<li>Begin each sentence with an action verb</li>
</ul>
        <p>Employers are primarily interested in the degree of responsibility you held, the skills
        you demonstrated, and the results you obtained. To effectively communicate these ideas,
        replace statements such as &quot;Responsible for...&quot; and &quot;Created system to
        increase sales&quot; with accomplishment statements. Accomplishments convincingly
        demonstrate that you know how to utilize your skills to work effectively and produce
        results.</p>
		
<li><STRONG>Tip:</STRONG> Show how you made an IMPROVEMENT at every job.<p>

Do not simply reaffirm that you were there; convey easily and concisely what you changed, and did differently or better at each experience. Make sure the results that you obtained are stated explicitly.</li>

<hr size="1" noshade>	
		
		
		
<a name="references"></a>
<h5>References</h5>
<p>
It is preferable to use the statement "References Available upon Request" under this heading and have the names, addresses and phone numbers of three references on a separate sheet to hand to the employer during an interview.

    <td class="body" width="50%">Accomplishments can be large or small and both are equally
      important and valid for inclusion on your resume. According to James Cabrera and Charles
      Albrecht, authors of The Lifetime Career Manager, an accomplishment fulfills at least one of
      the following conditions:
      <ul>
        <li>Greater results were achieved with the same resources (budget, people or equipment for
          example) than had been achieved previously<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>The same results were achieved with fewer resources than had been used previously<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>Operations were improved or things were made easier or better than they were before<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>A problem or panic situation was resolved with little or no increase in time, energy,
          dollars or people<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>Something new or different was brought about</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As you develop a list of your accomplishments, you will gain an awareness of things you
      have done well, obtain the information needed to identify work skills, and generate a skill
      inventory that will assist in assessing your employability in similar or diverse jobs,
      industries, functions and locations. Additionally, these accomplishments can be used during
      interviews.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</td>
    <td class="body" width="50%">To determine your accomplishments, Cabrera and Albrecht suggest
      asking yourself the following questions:
      <ul>
        <li>Did I see a problem, opportunity, or challenge for which I took the initiative to create
          a solution?<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>Did I develop something?<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>Did I create or design a new department, program, procedure, plan, service, or product?<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>Did I identify a need for a new department, program, procedure, plan, service, or
          product?<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>Did I prepare an original report, paper, or document?<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>Did I make a direct or indirect technical contribution?<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>Directly or indirectly, did I create or implement an administrative or procedural
          recommendation?<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>Did I participate actively in a major decision related to organizational changes
          (hiring, terminating, salary, new projects, etc)?<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
