== Setting up openwikiNG on your system ==

= What you need =

1) A web server that will run Microsoft ASP (Active Scripting Pages)

This can be:
a) Windows Server with IIS5 or IIS6
b) Windows XP with IIS installed
c) Personal Web Server from Microsoft
note: this application has not been tested with Chillisoft ASP add-on

2) A database connection

This can be:
a) Microsoft SQL Server V7, 2000 or 2003 or MSDE
b) Microsoft Access (you don't need the program, just the drivers)
note: If you have MS Office installed, this should be enough

= What to do =

1) Unzip all the files to an empty folder
note: be sure to preserve the paths when unzipping

2) Point your web server, or make a virtual directory thet points to
 the openwiking/owbase folder

3) Make sure that the account the web server uses has full permissions
 on the openwiking/owbase/data folder

If you are using the MSAccess database, your Wiki should now work!

= If you are using MS SQL Server ==

1) Make a new database: Initial size:20MB Log size:10MB autogrow=true

2) Use the SQL script: /openwiki/data/OpenWiki-SqlServer.sql to initialise
 the new database.  Be sure the web account has full dbo permissions.

3) Make an new ODBC connection called 'openwiking' to point to it

4) Edit the file /openwiking/owbase/ow/owconig_default.asp
 lines 70 and 71.  Remove the apostrophes at the start
OPENWIKI_DB = "openwiking" ' Override earlier setting
OPENWIKI_DB_SYNTAX = DB_SQLSERVER ' Override earlier setting

Your Wiki should now work!

= Configuring your new openwikiNG =

The file /openwiking/owbase/ow/owconig_default.asp is the config file

1 ) Back it up!

2) Use a text editor like 'NotePad' to view and edit it
