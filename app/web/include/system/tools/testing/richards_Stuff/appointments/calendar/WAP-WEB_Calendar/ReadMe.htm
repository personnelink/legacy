      <h4>Web / WAP Calendar from Harrison Logic</h4>
      <p>Version Completed: 9-27-2001&nbsp; (Tested 12-3-2002)</p>
      <p>Thanks for your interest in the Web / WAP Calendar.&nbsp; This
      application provides an updateable web-based calendar that can be viewed
      from both the Web and through a Mobile device, such as a cellular phone.</p>
      <h5>Requirements:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>The files should work on any Web Server with ASP.</li>
        <li>You will need to specify the MIME Settings for WML on your web
          Server.&nbsp; To do this follow these steps:<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; 1)&nbsp; Open your Internet Services Manager (Win2000) or
          Internet MMC (Win NT)<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; 2)&nbsp; Rt-Click your server and Choose Properties<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; 3)&nbsp; Select the WWW Properties and choose Edit<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; 4)&nbsp; On the 'HTTP Headers' tab, choose &quot;File
          types&quot; then &quot;New Type'<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; 5)&nbsp; Enter &quot;.wml&quot; for the extension, and
          &quot;text/vnd.wap.wml&quot; for MIME</li>
        <li>You can view the Mobile portion through your cell phone or through
          an Emulator, such as OpenWave's emulator.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Installation Instructions:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Unzip the files and place them in a Directory in your web server
          root</li>
        <li>You should have two folders in your root, Calendar for the Web portion,
          and C for the mobile portion.&nbsp; If you change this, you will need
          to modify the Connection string in &quot;Calendar/DBConnect.asp&quot;
          and &quot;C/functions.asp&quot;, otherwise you are fine.</li>
        <li>The application should work as is.&nbsp; (Check in the DB folder to make sure
          the Database (Calendar/Cal.mdb) is not 'Read Only'.)</li>
        <li>You can customize the look with the Style.css or simply copy past
          them into your<br>
          own .asp pages.&nbsp;</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Use Cases:</h5>
