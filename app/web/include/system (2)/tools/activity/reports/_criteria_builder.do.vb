' want to include a common name space accross all reports, may need to rename and create / standard names
'
' want to be completely independant, both loading - via getParameter, for example, everything for itself
'
' so any report can have it used as a drop in element, and it styles itself loosely and reports can access
'
' a common namespace of parameters (list these below eventually)
