    <p>There are no fees for our services.</p>
    <h2><span>How do I get paid?</span></h2>
    <p>We process payrolls weekly, bi-weekly and semi-monthly depending on the client company you work for.</p>
    <h2><span>Who is my actual employer?</span></h2>
    <p>When we send an associate to a client we become the employer of record. This means that we take care of payroll taxes, workers compensation, and unemployment insurance.</p>
    <p>Any questions involving the associate must then be directed to Personnel Plus, Inc.</p>
    <h2><span>What is the Hazard Communication Standard?</span></h2>
    <p>The Hazard Communication standard implements the "Right to Know Act" related to the workplace. The code sets requirements for information and training with hazardous chemicals used in the workplace. Federal law requires all states to comply with hazard communication regulations.</p>
    <h2><span>What if I am injured on the job?</span></h2>
    <p>Please inform your supervisor immediately if you are injured on the job. We do maintain workers compensation insurance for all our employees.</p>
    <p>You are required to complete a "first report of injury" within 48 hours of the incident. Failure to complete this report within the 48 hours may result in denial of the claim by Personnel Plus, Inc.</p>
    <h2><span>Do you have a drug and alcohol policy?</span></h2>
    <p>Yes. The use of drugs and alcohol in the workplace creates a danger for all those involved. Your safety and the safety of others are always in danger if drugs and alcohol are present.</p>
    <p>We perform pre employment drug testing, random and post accident testing. We are a &quot;Drug Free Workplace!&quot;</p>
