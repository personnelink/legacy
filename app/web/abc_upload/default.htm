<h1>ABCUpload Examples</h1>
<p>The following examples demonstrate how to use ABCUpload. They take you through 
  from the most basic of uploads to a full featured upload with progress bar and 
  insertion of BLOB data into a database. The structure of the HTML is designed 
  to be as simple as possible to avoid distracting from the basic functionality. 
  All the examples are explained in detail in the ABCUpload documentation.</p>
