NLucene
-------

NLucene is the .NET implementation of the Lucene high-performance,
full-featured text search engine written in Java.
See http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene for more info on Lucene.


The latest version
------------------
Details of the latest version can be found on the NLucene project web site
http://sourceforge.net/projects/nlucene


Documentation
-------------
See doc/classes/NLucene.chm for description of NLucene class library.
See http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene for additional information/links on Lucene.


Examples
--------
There is a simple Windows Forms application in the examples/NLucene directory that
demonstrates the basic technique of indexing and searching. This sample application
is able to index only *.txt files.


Contributions
-------------
I think NLucene is a very interesting project as well and there is a lot to do still.
NLucene provides to developers only indexing/searching API and doesn't provide an other
suitable utilities such as crawlers, admin library, ASP.NET/XML Web Services front store
and so on.

NLucene is a quite complex project, so, other developers who are interesting in futher
developments and improvements of NLucene project are always welcome.
I'll be waiting for your suggestions, ideas, bugs and so on.
You can freely write to me (fitsner@msn.com).


TODO
----
1.Developing crawlers:
  1.1. Web crawler.
  1.2. File system crawler.
2.Developing the document factory that will maintain the creation of documents from files
  of different types such as .html, .xml, .doc, etc.
3.Developing an administrative API.
