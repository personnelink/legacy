				<h4>Emergency Procedures</h4>
			</p>
			<p>
				The client company to which you are assigned will have a written, up-to-date <strong>Emergency Action<br>
				Plan</strong> for your workplace.  Make sure you read and understand the <strong>Emergency Action Plan</strong> of the<br>
				client as it relates to your work area.
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul><b>The following items may be included in the <i>Emergency Action Plan</i>:</b>
					<li>The plan should contain information about evacuation from the<br>
						facility, including who is in charge of the evacuation.</li>
					<li>Primary and secondary escape routes should be outlined for every<br>
						area of the building.  Since stairways are the primary escape route<br>
						in multiple-story buildings, they should not be used for any kind of<br>
						storage.</li>
					<li><i>Emergency Action Leaders</i> should be assigned specific duties, such<br>
						as verifying that all workers have evacuated.</li>
					<li>Pre-fire planning must clearly show the locations of the<br>
						workstations of disabled workers.</li>
					<li>Disabled workers and those with known medical problems, such as<br>
						heart disease or epilepsy, should each be assigned an <i>Emergency<br>
						Action Leader</i> to guide them to safety.</li>
					<li>All other workers who might need assistance during a fire should<br>
						be identified during planning.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<b>How to evacuate a burning building:</b>
					<li>The last one out of the room should not lock the door, just close it.</li>
					<ul><li>Locking the door hinders the fire department's search and rescue<br>
						efforts.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Proceed to the exit as outlined in the <i>Emergency Action Plan</i>.</li>
					<li>Don't use elevators under any circumstances.</li>
					<li>Stay low to avoid smoke and toxic gases.  The best air is close to<br>
						the floor, so crawl if necessary.</li>
					<li>If possible, cover your mouth and nose with damp cloth to help you<br>
						breathe.</li>
					<li>If you work in a building with multiple stories, a stairway will be<br>
						your primary escape route.</li>
					<li>Once in the stairwell, proceed on to the first floor.  Never go up.</li>
					<li>Once outside the building, report to a predetermined area so that a<br>
						head count can be taken.</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>First Aid:</h4>
			</p>

				First aid kits equipped with basic bandages and non-prescription pharmaceutical products should<br>
				be located in the office and are to be accessed as necessary.

						avoid exposing any other employees to blood or other body fluids.</li>
					<li>Know who in the office is a first aid responder (first aid techniques CPR and<br>
						Heimlich maneuver).</li>

			</p>

						drawer first.</li>
					<li>Use a letter opener rather than your fingers if you need to open a stack of<br>
						envelopes.</li>
					<li>Don't lift a piece of paper by the sides; instead, be sure t pick t up by a<br>
						corner.</li>
					<li>Use a letter opener when opening a carton or a package that's closed with<br>
						tape.</li>
					<li>Report any desk and file drawers which don't open or close easily.</li>
