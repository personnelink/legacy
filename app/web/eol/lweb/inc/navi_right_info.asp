						Now more than ever, businesses turn to Personnel Plus for 
						comprehensive and strategic staffing solutions. We have a proven 
						track record of over 14 years in the staffing business. We offer 
						you many convenient and efficient staffing options tailored to 
						serve your needs. Below is an overview of the staffing services 
						we provide:
						<P></P>
						<STRONG>Flexible Staffing</STRONG> enables the client to have a smaller number 
						of full-time employees and hire flexible staffers during peak 
						productivity times, thus allowing labor costs to become variable 
						rather than fixed.
						<P></P>
						<STRONG>Direct Hire</STRONG> saves the client the time and cost of extensive 
						recruiting. Clients increase productivity and quality by 
						allowing Personnel Plus to provide highly qualified individuals 
						that have been carefully selected and are pre-qualified.
						<P></P>
						<STRONG>On-Premise Systems</STRONG> (OPS) allows for the administration of your 
						company's entire flexible workforce or assumption of any level 
						of on-site management responsibility that your workforce 
						demands.
