    may ask about an applicant’s conviction record.<b><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><br>
    Disability: </span></b>It is not appropriate to ask an applicant whether or 
    not they have a particular disability. However, you may ask if the applicant 
    can perform the basic functions of the position.<b><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><br>

    about religious obligations that may restrict the availability to work on 
    certain days or times, then you may ask &quot;<b><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Are 
    there any times you are unavailable to work?&quot;<br>
    Sexual Preference</span></b>: Federal law does not address the issue of 
    sexual preference. However some state and local laws do consider sexual 
    preference a protected class. Therefore, in those particular locations there

    </span></font></b><font face="Arial" size="2">
    <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Employment discrimination 
    is prohibited against &quot;qualified individuals with disabilities.&quot; This 
    includes applicants for employment and employees. An individual is 
    considered to have a &quot;disability&quot; if s/he has a physical or mental 
    impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, has 
    a record of such impairment, or is regarded as having such impairment. 
    Persons discriminated against because they have a known association or 
    relationship with an individual with a disability also is protected. <br>
    <br>
    The first part of the definition makes clear that the ADA applies to persons 
    who have impairments and that these must substantially limit major life 
    activities such as seeing, hearing, speaking, walking, breathing, performing 
    manual tasks, learning, caring for oneself, and working. An individual with 
    epilepsy, paralysis, HIV infection, AIDS, a substantial hearing or visual 
    impairment, mental retardation, or a specific learning disability is 
    covered, but an individual with a minor, non-chronic condition of short 
    duration, such as a sprain, broken limb, or the flu, generally would not be 
    covered.<br>
    <br>
    The second part of the definition protecting individuals with a record of a 
    disability would cover, for example, a person who has recovered from cancer 
    or mental illness.<br>
    <br>
    The third part of the definition protects individuals who are regarded as 
    having a substantially limiting impairment, even though they may not have 
    such impairment. For example, this provision would protect a qualified 
    individual with a severe facial disfigurement from being denied employment 
    because an employer feared the &quot;negative reactions&quot; of customers or 
    co-workers.</span></font></p>

    <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">A qualified individual 
    with a disability is a person who meets legitimate skill, experience, 
    education, or other requirements of an employment position that s/he holds 
    or seeks, and who can perform the &quot;essential functions&quot; of the position with 
    or without reasonable accommodation. Requiring the ability to perform 
    &quot;essential&quot; functions assures that an individual with a disability will not 
    be considered unqualified simply because of inability to perform marginal or 
    incidental job functions. If the individual is qualified to perform 
    essential job functions except for limitations caused by a disability, the 
    employer must consider whether the individual could perform these functions 
    with a reasonable accommodation. If a written job description has been 
    prepared in advance of advertising or interviewing applicants for a job, 
    this will be considered as evidence, although not conclusive evidence, of 
    the essential functions of the job.</span></font></p>

    </span></font></b><font face="Arial" size="2">
    <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">No. An employer is free to 
    select the most qualified applicant available and to make decisions based on 
    reasons unrelated to a disability. For example, suppose two persons apply 
    for a job as a typist and an essential function of the job is to type 75 
    words per minute accurately. One applicant, an individual with a disability, 
    who is provided with a reasonable accommodation for a typing test, types 50 
    words per minute; the other applicant who has no disability accurately types 
    75 words per minute. The employer can hire the applicant with the higher 
    typing speed, if typing speed is needed for successful performance of the 
    job.</span></font></p>

    require employers to develop or maintain job descriptions. However, a 
    written job description that is prepared before advertising or interviewing 
    applicants for a job will be considered as evidence along with other 
    relevant factors. If an employer uses job descriptions, they should be 
    reviewed to make sure they accurately reflect the actual functions of a job. 
    A job description will be most helpful if it focuses on the results or 
    outcome of a job function, not solely on the way it customarily is 
    performed. A reasonable accommodation may enable a person with a disability 
    to accomplish a job function in a manner that is different from the way an 
    employee who is not disabled may accomplish the same function.</span></font></p>

    training, or other programs. Reasonable accommodation also may include 
    reassigning a current employee to a vacant position for which the individual 
    is qualified, if the person is unable to do the original job because of a 
    disability even with an accommodation. However, there is no obligation to 
    find a position for an applicant who is not qualified for the position 
    sought. Employers are not required to lower quality or quantity standards as 
    an accommodation; nor are they obligated to provide personal use items such 
    as glasses or hearing aids.&nbsp; The decision as to the appropriate 
    accommodation must be based on the particular facts of each case. In 
    selecting the particular type of reasonable accommodation to provide, the 
    principal test is that of effectiveness, i.e., whether the accommodation 
    will provide an opportunity for a person with a disability to achieve the 
    same level of performance and to enjoy benefits equal to those of an 
    average, similarly situated person without a disability. However, the

    the operation of the employer's business. &quot;Undue hardship&quot; is defined as an 
    &quot;action requiring significant difficulty or expense&quot; when considered in 
    light of a number of factors. These factors include the nature and cost of 
    the accommodation in relation to the size, resources, nature, and structure 
    of the employer's operation. Undue hardship is determined on a case-by-case 
    basis. Where the facility making the accommodation is part of a larger 
    entity, the structure and overall resources of the larger organization would 
    be considered, as well as the financial and administrative relationship of 
    the facility to the larger organization. In general, a larger employer with 
    greater resources would be expected to make accommodations requiring greater 
    effort or expense than would be required of a smaller employer with fewer 
    resources.&nbsp; If a particular accommodation would be an undue hardship, 
    the employer must try to identify another accommodation that will not pose 
    such a hardship. Also, if the cost of an accommodation would impose an undue 
    hardship on the employer, the individual with a disability should be given 
    the option of paying that portion of the cost, which would constitute an 
    undue hardship, or providing the accommodation.</span></font></p>

    provided in a location that would enable the individual to take a break with 
    co-workers. The employer must provide such access unless it would cause an 
    undue hardship.&nbsp; Under title I, an employer is not required to make its 
    existing facilities accessible until a particular applicant or employee with 
    a particular disability needs an accommodation, and then the modifications

    more severe effect on an individual because of his/her disability. However, 
    if an individual with a disability requests a modification of such a policy

    <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Yes. The ADA permits

    </span></b>substantial harm --to the health or safety of the individual or 
    of others, if that risk cannot be eliminated or reduced below the level of a 
    &quot;direct threat&quot; by reasonable accommodation. However, an employer may not 
    simply assume that a threat exists; the employer must establish through 
    objective, medically supportable methods that there is significant risk that 
    substantial harm could occur in the workplace. By requiring employers to 
    make individualized judgments based on reliable medical or other objective 
    evidence rather than on generalizations, ignorance, fear, patronizing 
    attitudes, or stereotypes, the ADA recognizes the need to balance the 
    interests of people with disabilities against the legitimate interests of 
    employers in maintaining a safe workplace.</span></font></p>

    </span></font></b><font face="Arial" size="2">
    <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The ADA does not override 
    health and safety requirements established under other Federal laws even if 
    a standard adversely affects the employment of an individual with a 
    disability. If a standard is required by another Federal law, an employer 
    must comply with it and does not have to show that the standard is job 
    related and consistent with business necessity. For example, employers must 
    conform to health and safety requirements of the U.S. Occupational Safety 
    and Health Administration. However, an employer still has the obligation 
    under the ADA to consider whether there is a reasonable accommodation, 
    consistent with the standards of other Federal laws, that will prevent 
    exclusion of qualified individuals with disabilities who can perform jobs 
    without violating the standards of those laws. If an employer can comply 
    with both the ADA and another Federal law, then the employer must do so.&nbsp; 
    The ADA does not override State or local laws designed to protect public 
    health and safety, except where such laws conflict with the ADA 
    requirements. If there is a State or local law that would exclude an 
    individual with a disability from a particular job or profession because of 
    a health or safety risk, the employer still must assess whether a particular 
    individual would pose a &quot;direct threat&quot; to health or safety under the ADA 
    standard. If such a &quot;direct threat&quot; exists, the employer must consider 
    whether it could be eliminated or reduced below the level of a &quot;direct 
    threat&quot; by reasonable accommodation. An employer cannot rely on a State or 
    local law that conflicts with ADA requirements as a defense to a charge of 
    discrimination.</span></font></p>

    <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Only injured workers who 
    meet the ADA's definition of an &quot;individual with a disability&quot; will be 
    considered disabled under the ADA, regardless of whether they satisfy 
    criteria for receiving benefits under workers' compensation or other 
    disability laws. A worker also must be &quot;qualified&quot; (with or without 
    reasonable accommodation) to be protected by the ADA. Work-related injuries 
    do not always cause physical or mental impairments severe enough to 
    &quot;substantially limit&quot; a major life activity. Also, many on-the-job injuries 
    cause temporary impairments, which heal within a short period of time with 
    little or no long-term or permanent impact. Therefore, many injured workers 
    who qualify for benefits under workers' compensation or other disability 
    benefits laws may not be protected by the ADA. An employer must consider 
    work-related injuries on a case-by-case basis to know if a worker is 
    protected by the ADA. An employer may not inquire into an applicant's 
    workers' compensation history before making a conditional offer of 
    employment. After making a conditional job offer, an employer may inquire 
    about a person's workers' compensation history in a medical inquiry or 
    examination that is required of all applicants in the same job category. 
    However, even after a conditional offer has been made, an employer cannot 
    require a potential employee to have a medical examination because a 
    response to a medical inquiry (as opposed to results from a medical 
    examination) shows a previous on-the-job injury unless all applicants in the 
    same job category are required to have an examination. Also, an employer may 
    not base an employment decision on the speculation that an applicant may 
    cause increased workers' compensation costs in the future. However, an 
    employer may refuse to hire, or may discharge an individual who is not 
    currently able to perform a job without posing a significant risk of 
    substantial harm to the health or safety of the individual or others, if the 
    risk cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation.<br>

    An employer may refuse to hire or may fire a person who knowingly provides a 
    false answer to a lawful post-offer inquiry about his/her condition or 
    worker's compensation history.<br>

    An employer also may submit medical information and records concerning

    Similarly, a covered employee's spouse or dependent (other than an 
    after-born or adopted child) is not a qualified beneficiary if he or she is 
    not actually covered by the plan on the day before the qualifying event.&nbsp;

    </span></font></b><font face="Arial" size="2">
    <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">A reduction of hours 
    occurs whenever there is a decrease in the hours that a covered employee is 
    required to work or actually works, as long as there is no immediate 
    termination of employment. Thus, a switch from full-time or part-time work 
    would trigger COBRA coverage if the employee loses health benefits as a 
    result of the change. An absence due to disability or a temporary layoff is 
    also a reduction in hours, even though the employee's hours are reduced to 
    zero.<br>
    <br>
    If a plan measures eligibility for coverage by the number of hours worked in 
    a given time period, such as the preceding month or quarter, an employee who 
    fails to work the requisite hours has experienced a reduction in hours

    <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">When a qualifying event 
    occurs, each qualified beneficiary who loses coverage must be offered the 
    opportunity to elect to receive the same group health coverage that is 
    provided to similarly situated active employees and their family members who 
    have not experienced a qualifying event (called &quot;non-COBRA beneficiaries&quot;). 
    Ordinarily, this will be the same coverage that the qualified beneficiary 
    had on the day before the qualifying event.&nbsp; This was a change from the 
    old proposed regulations, where employers whose plans included both core 
    medical age and non-core coverage (such as vision or dental benefits) were 
    required to carve out and offer core-only coverage to COBRA beneficiaries. 
    The final regulations drop that requirement, and your company can simply 
    offer COBRA beneficiaries the same health package they had elected before 
    the qualifying event.</span></font></p>

    coverage, the employer was required to allow the beneficiary to switch to 
    any other plan available to similarly situated non-COBRA beneficiaries.&nbsp; 
    However, the final regulations provide that COBRA beneficiaries are 
    basically in the same boat as active employees and their families. Any 
    change in benefits applies equally to both COBRA and non-COBRA 
    beneficiaries. However, an employer can't cut off coverage for COBRA 
    beneficiaries if it maintains any health plans. If an employer eliminates a 
    plan, any COBRA beneficiaries enrolled in that plan must be offered the 
    option of enrolling in another plan, even if active employees are not

    seller ceases to provide any group health plan to any employee in connection 
    with the sale, the buyer is responsible for providing COBRA coverage to 
    existing, qualified beneficiaries.&nbsp; On the other hand, the regulations 
    provide that the buyer and seller are free to allocate the responsibility 
    for providing COBRA coverage by contract, even if the contract imposes 
    responsibility on a different party than the party that would be responsible 
    under the regulations. As long as the party to whom the contract allocates 
    responsibility follows through, the other party will have no responsibility

    <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">COBRA beneficiaries are

    retain credit for expenses incurred before the COBRA event occurred.&nbsp; 
    If the plan computes deductibles separately for each individual covered by 
    the plan, an individual's remaining deductible on the date COBRA coverage 
    begins is the same as that individual's deductible on the day before the 
    COBRA event.&nbsp; The proposed regulations provided that all expenses 
    credited against a family unit were carried over for the COBRA coverage. The 
    new regulations provide that the remaining deductible for the family on the 
    date that COBRA coverage begins depends on the members of the family 
    electing COBRA coverage. In other words, only the expenses of those members 
    actually electing COBRA coverage need to be taken into account. Moreover, if 
    there is more than one family unit following the qualifying event (for

    switch plans or benefit packages or add or eliminate family members, the 
    same enrollment period rights must be given to the COBRA beneficiary.<br>

    HIPAA may also give COBRA beneficiaries the right to add new family members

    for adoption with a covered employee during the period of COBRA coverage, 
    family members who were not covered at the time of a qualifying event are

    coverage period began will qualify if he or she remains disabled on the date 
    COBRA coverage begins. The 29-month coverage period is not limited to the 
    disabled beneficiary. It applies to each qualified beneficiary who is 
    entitled to COBRA coverage because of the same qualifying event.&nbsp; The 
    60-day period is measured from the date of the qualifying event (or loss of 
    coverage, if later), not the COBRA election. In the case of a child who is 
    born to or placed for adoption with a covered employee during a period of 
    COBRA coverage, the 60-day period is measured from the date of birth or 
    placement for adoption.&nbsp; To qualify for the extension, a qualified 
    beneficiary who was affected by the qualifying event must give notice to the 
    plan administrator of the disability determination within 60 days after the 
    date of the determination and before the end of the 18-month COBRA period.&nbsp; 
    The new proposed regulations make it clear that COBRA coverage can be 
    terminated in the month that is more than 30 days after a final 
    determination that the qualified beneficiary is no longer disabled. The 
    termination applies to all qualified beneficiaries who received an extension 
    because of the disability of the qualified beneficiary who is no longer 
    disabled. However, COBRA coverage cannot be cut off before the end of the 
    initial 18-month period.&nbsp; An initial 18-month coverage period (or a 
    29-month disability coverage period) will be extended to 36 months if a

    one that would trigger 36 months of coverage. Thus, a termination of

    before the end of the election period?</span></span></font><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;
    </span></font></span></b><font face="Arial" size="2">
    <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">A waiver may be revoked at 
    any time before the end of the election period. However, coverage does not 
    have to be provided retroactively. In other words, the beneficiary does not 
    have to be given coverage from the date employer-provided coverage was lost 
    until the date of the revocation.</span></font></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial">
    <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Can the employer 
    withhold money or other benefits until a beneficiary makes up his or her

    <font face="Arial" size="2">
    <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">No. An employer can't 
    withhold anything a beneficiary is entitled to in order to compel payment 
    for COBRA coverage or to induce the beneficiary to give up his or her COBRA 
    rights (including the right to make full use of the election period). What's 
    more, a waiver obtained by means of withholding other benefits or money is 
    invalid.</span></font></p>

    <font face="Arial" size="2">
    <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Yes. Each beneficiary 
    (including a child who is born to or placed with a covered employee after 
    the event) must be offered the opportunity to make an independent election 
    to receive COBRA coverage. However, if a covered employee or spouse of a 
    covered employee makes a COBRA election that does not specify whether the 
    election is for self-only coverage, the election is deemed to be for all 
    beneficiaries who lost coverage on account of the same event.</span></font></p>

    <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">How do beneficiaries pay 
    for COBRA coverage?<font size="2">&nbsp; </font></span></font></b>
    <font face="Arial" size="2">
    <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">An employer can require a 
    qualified beneficiary to pay up to 102% of the applicable premium for the 
    COBRA coverage period. The payment may be raised to 150% of the applicable 
    premium for any disability extension period.</span></font></p>

    the premium?<font size="2">&nbsp; </font></span></font></b>
    <font face="Arial" size="2">
    <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The law says the 
    applicable premium is what it costs the plan for coverage for similarly 
    situated non-COBRA beneficiaries. The COBRA premium must be determined in 
    advance of each &quot;determination period.&quot; The determination period can be any 
    12-month period selected by the plan, but the same period must be used from 
    year to year.</span></font></p>

    </font></span></font></b><font face="Arial" size="2">
    <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Yes, the beneficiary may 
    be charged retroactively for the entire period from the date of the loss of 
    coverage. However, the regulations make it clear that a plan can allow a 
    beneficiary to apply the first payment prospectively only.</span></font></p>

      <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The plan initially

      <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The increase is made

    </font></b><font face="Arial" size="2">
    <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The plan must allow 
    payment for COBRA coverage to be made in monthly installments. However, a 
    plan can also allow payments at other intervals (for example, weekly, 
    quarterly, or semiannually).</span></font></p>

    <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">As noted above, a plan may 
    cancel the coverage for failure to pay on time. However, the regulations 
    make it clear that a payment is timely if it is made within 30 days of the 
    beginning of the coverage period. A plan can, however, allow a longer grace 
    period.&nbsp; A beneficiary's initial payment for COBRA coverage can't be 
    required to be made earlier than 45 days after the COBRA election is made.</span></font></p>

    <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">What if the beneficiary

    <font face="Arial" size="2">
    <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">If a payment is not 
    significantly less than the required amount, the payment will be deemed made 
    in full unless the plan notifies the beneficiary of the shortfall and grants 
    a reasonable time for payment of the deficiency. For this purpose, the 
    regulations say 30 days is a reasonable time.</span></font><!--mstheme--></font></td>
