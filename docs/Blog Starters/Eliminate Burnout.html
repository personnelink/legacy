<P>Are there moments when you realize your
life needs simplified? Things have just become to complicated. Phones
of all flavors, text, email, text being email … messaging period;
we're more available to any and everyone than ever. Maintaining our
focus with out interruption is all the more unlikely. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>These are a few methods that can help
to eliminate burnout and get you back on track.</P>
<P><BR>

<P><B>Take attention to your self care.</B>
Taking good care of YOU is critical if you intend to put the “best”
of you forward in every part of your daily life and with the people
and situations you encounter instead of  the left overs of you!
Making sure you're giving yourself permission to make self-care a
priority. Self-care will show others how to perceive and respect you
by valuing and appreciating who you are [and not leaving a lingering
aroma to the opposite on your way out].</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><B>Establish rigid boundaries and
enforce them. </B>Use the
word &quot;no&quot; more often, and especially when saying &quot;yes&quot;
would be lying to yourself.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><B>Delegate tasks for others that they
can handle.</B> Superheroes are characters in comic books and
stories, and while they are fun to imagine and think about … they
aren't real! If you are trying to do it all by yourself, a full one
person show, then it's time to consider help. It is important to give
up some of the control in order to decrease the number of things
swarming your &quot;tasks&quot; list. Being able to recognize when
you have a need AND being able to ask for help (when possible) are
critical. Never forgetting the fact that the most successful people
work in teams; they don't succeed alone.</P>

</P>
<P><B>Get rid of completely or reduce
energy drains.</B> Clutter, situations, people are all things that
sap your energy! Get rid of them. Stuff that drains us are: things
that are unresolved, unfinished, undone, implete or avoided. For
examples: clutter, unanswered messages, unfinished business, repairs,
unpaid bills, avoided conflicts/confrontations, negative thinking.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><B>And have fun!</B> Every one of us
requires downtime. Always make sure to mix in some fun into your life
– your productivity and quality of life will thank you! :)</P>
