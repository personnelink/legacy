[mvaldez@personnel.com]  Hey Gus! Alot of my attachments through the website are not opening up. They won't work. Wondered if you knew why?? Thanks  
[mvaldez@personnel.com]  Let me explain better. Alot of the attachments on employees when I go to maintain them are not opening up. It seems like only the newer ones will open. If I use temps plus they will open but as far as online they don't work. Didn't know if that was a big deal or not but thought I would tell you.
