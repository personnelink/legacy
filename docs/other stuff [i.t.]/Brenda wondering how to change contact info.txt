[bbailey@personnel.com]  Hi Gus, I went into the web site to change the people who are listed as contacts in the Burley Office as Juan is still listed as receptionist.  I tried to go into Management; Manager Users and I'm not allowed to change anything.  Where do I go to update the contacts in the Burley Office?
